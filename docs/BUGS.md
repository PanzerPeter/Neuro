# Known Bugs

Open defects only, newest first. Every confirmed bug that is not yet fixed has a numbered
`BUG-NNN` entry here; when a bug is fixed its entry is **deleted**, the fix lives in
`CHANGELOG.md`, in the affected slice's `CONTEXT.md`, and in its regression test. IDs are
never reused, so numbering stays stable as entries are removed.

There are no open defects on record right now.

## Taking one of these on

Each entry below is a self-contained task: repro, root cause where known, and a fix
sketch. If you want to work on one:

1. Open (or claim) an issue naming the `BUG-NNN` id so work isn't duplicated.
2. Follow the normal [contribution workflow](../CONTRIBUTING.md), branch, tests,
   quality gates, DCO sign-off.
3. A bug fix **must** ship with a regression test that fails without the fix. Name it
   after the defect so its purpose is obvious.
4. If an entry turns out to be a language-design decision rather than a patch, say so in
   the issue, some of these need a maintainer ruling before code changes.

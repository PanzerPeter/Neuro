# GPU Programming in NEURO - User Guide (Phase 2 - In Development)

## Current Status

GPU programming support in NEURO is currently under development as part of Phase 2. The basic framework and infrastructure are in place, but full GPU kernel compilation is not yet implemented.

## Current Implementation Status

**=Ë INFRASTRUCTURE READY (Phase 1 Complete):**
-  GPU compilation framework architecture
-  Basic attribute parsing for `#[kernel]` and `#[gpu]`
-  LLVM backend infrastructure (ready for GPU extensions)
-  Memory management system (ready for GPU memory)

**<× IN DEVELOPMENT (Phase 2):**
- <× CUDA kernel compilation
- <× Vulkan compute shader generation
- <× GPU memory management
- <× Cross-platform GPU abstraction
- <× GPU-specific optimizations

**=Å PLANNED FEATURES:**

### CUDA Support
```neuro
#[kernel(gpu = "cuda")]
fn vector_add(a: &Tensor<f32, [N]>, b: &Tensor<f32, [N]>) -> Tensor<f32, [N]> {
    // Will compile to CUDA kernel
    a + b
}
```

### Vulkan Compute Support
```neuro
#[kernel(gpu = "vulkan")]
fn matrix_multiply(a: &Tensor<f32, [M, K]>, b: &Tensor<f32, [K, N]>) -> Tensor<f32, [M, N]> {
    // Will compile to Vulkan compute shader
    a @ b
}
```

### Cross-Platform Kernels
```neuro
#[kernel(gpu = "cuda,vulkan")]
fn universal_kernel(data: &Tensor<f32>) -> Tensor<f32> {
    // Will compile to both CUDA and Vulkan
    data.relu()
}
```

## Development Timeline

GPU programming support is being developed in Phase 2 of the NEURO project:

- **Phase 2 Start**: After Phase 1 completion ( Complete)
- **CUDA Backend**: Q2 2024 (estimated)
- **Vulkan Backend**: Q3 2024 (estimated)
- **Full GPU Support**: Phase 2 completion (Q4 2024)
